# CodeTest

Here is the challenge:

Create an application using C#, .NET, and optionally ASP.NET that uses the “I can haz
dad joke” api(https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to display jokes. You are welcome to use
more technologies like Angular if you wish but its not required.
There should be two modes the user can choose between:
1. Display a random joke every 10 seconds.
2. Accept a search term and display the first 30 jokes containing that term, with
the matching term emphasized in some way (upper, bold, color, etc.) and the
matching jokes grouped by length: short(<10 words), medium (<20 words),
long (>= 20 words)
